# git-dep-scanner

git-dep-scanner is a command-line tool that scans Git repositories for dependency vulnerabilities and provides update suggestions. It helps developers keep their projects secure and up-to-date by identifying potential security risks and outdated packages.

## Features

- Scans Git repositories for dependency vulnerabilities
- Provides update suggestions for outdated packages
- Generates a colorful, easy-to-read report in the console
- Works with Node.js projects (npm)

## Installation

To install git-dep-scanner globally, run:

\`\`\`
npm install -g git-dep-scanner
\`\`\`

## Usage

To scan a Git repository, use the following command:

\`\`\`
git-dep-scanner /path/to/your/repo
\`\`\`

Replace `/path/to/your/repo` with the actual path to the Git repository you want to scan.

## Example Output

\`\`\`
Scanning repository...

Dependency Update Suggestions:
express: ^4.17.1 → ^4.18.2
lodash: ^4.17.20 → ^4.17.21

Vulnerability Alerts:
lodash (4.17.20): Prototype Pollution in lodash
Severity: high
Fix: Upgrade to lodash@4.17.21

express (4.17.1): Open Redirect in express
Severity: moderate

\`\`\`

## How It Works

git-dep-scanner performs the following steps:

1. Verifies that the provided path is a valid Git repository
2. Checks for the presence of a `package.json` file
3. Uses `npm-check-updates` to identify available package updates
4. Utilizes `snyk` to scan for known vulnerabilities in the dependencies
5. Generates a comprehensive report with update suggestions and vulnerability alerts
