# GitMate Smart Commit

**GitMate Smart Commit** is a powerful Git extension that generates smart commit messages based on your staged changes. It helps streamline your version control workflow by providing interactive, context-aware commit message suggestions.

## Features

- **Automatic Commit Message Generation:**  
  Generates a commit message based on the files that are staged. If fewer than 5 files are staged, it lists them explicitly; if more, it summarizes by file type.
- **Interactive Prompt:**  
  Lets you accept the suggested commit message, edit it, or cancel the commit altogether.
- **Globally Accessible:**  
  Once installed globally via npm, you can use it in any Git repository on your system.
- **Offline Capabilities:**  
  Works entirely offline without needing an internet connection.

## Installation

Install **GitMate Smart Commit** globally using npm:

```sh
npm install -g gitmate-smart-commit
```

## Usage

After installation, navigate to **any Git repository** on your system where you want to use the tool:

1. **Open a Terminal/Command Prompt and change directory to your Git repository:**

   ```sh
   cd /path/to/your/git/repository
   ```

2. **Stage your changes:**

   ```sh
   git add .
   ```

3. **Run the command:**

   ```sh
   git smart-commit
   ```

4. **Interactive Prompt:**  
   You'll see a suggested commit message, for example:

   ```
   Suggested Commit Message: "Updated index.js, auth.js, database.js (Bug Fix)"
   Use this message? (Y/N/Edit):
   ```

   - Type **Y** to accept and commit.
   - Type **N** to cancel.
   - Type **Edit** to modify the commit message before committing.

5. **View Help:**  
   For more details on usage, run:
   
   ```sh
   git smart-commit --help
   ```
