# GitMate Smart Commit

**GitMate Smart Commit** is a powerful Git extension that generates smart commit messages based on your staged changes. It helps streamline your version control workflow by providing interactive, context-aware commit message suggestions.

## Features

- **Automatic Commit Message Generation:**  
  Generates a commit message based on the files that are staged. If fewer than 5 files are staged, it lists them explicitly; if more, it summarizes by file type.
- **Interactive Prompt:**  
  Lets you accept the suggested commit message, edit it, or cancel the commit altogether.
- **Globally Accessible:**  
  Once installed globally via npm, you can use it in any Git repository on your system.
- **Offline Capabilities:**  
  Works entirely offline without needing an internet connection.

## Installation

Install **GitMate Smart Commit** globally using npm:

```sh
npm install -g gitmate-smart-commit
```

## Usage

After installation, navigate to **any Git repository** on your system where you want to use the tool:

1. **Open a Terminal/Command Prompt and change directory to your Git repository:**

   ```sh
   cd /path/to/your/git/repository
   ```

2. **Stage your changes:**

   ```sh
   git add .
   ```

3. **Run the command:**

   ```sh
   git smart-commit
   ```

4. **Interactive Prompt:**  
   You'll see a suggested commit message, for example:

   ```
   Suggested Commit Message: "Updated index.js, auth.js, database.js (Bug Fix)"
   Use this message? (Y/N/Edit):
   ```

   - Type **Y** to accept and commit.
   - Type **N** to cancel.
   - Type **Edit** to modify the commit message before committing.

5. **View Help:**  
   For more details on usage, run:
   
   ```sh
   git smart-commit --help
   ```

## Example

```sh
cd /path/to/your/git/repository

# git-dep-scanner

git-dep-scanner is a command-line tool that scans Git repositories for dependency vulnerabilities and provides update suggestions. It helps developers keep their projects secure and up-to-date by identifying potential security risks and outdated packages.

## Features

- Scans Git repositories for dependency vulnerabilities
- Provides update suggestions for outdated packages
- Generates a colorful, easy-to-read report in the console
- Works with Node.js projects (npm)

## Installation

To install git-dep-scanner globally, run:

\`\`\`
npm install -g git-dep-scanner
\`\`\`

## Usage

To scan a Git repository, use the following command:

\`\`\`
git-dep-scanner /path/to/your/repo
\`\`\`

Replace `/path/to/your/repo` with the actual path to the Git repository you want to scan.

## Example Output

\`\`\`
Scanning repository...

Dependency Update Suggestions:
express: ^4.17.1 â†’ ^4.18.2
lodash: ^4.17.20 â†’ ^4.17.21

Vulnerability Alerts:
lodash (4.17.20): Prototype Pollution in lodash
Severity: high
Fix: Upgrade to lodash@4.17.21

express (4.17.1): Open Redirect in express
Severity: moderate
Fix: Upgrade to express@4.17.3
\`\`\`

## How It Works

git-dep-scanner performs the following steps:

1. Verifies that the provided path is a valid Git repository
2. Checks for the presence of a `package.json` file
3. Uses `npm-check-updates` to identify available package updates
4. Utilizes `snyk` to scan for known vulnerabilities in the dependencies
5. Generates a comprehensive report with update suggestions and vulnerability alerts
